# CEPHEID-VARIABLES-WITH-GAIA
Code &amp; analysis for Cepheid variables using Gaia DR3. Uses ADQL to study period-luminosity-metallicity relationships, improving cosmic distance measurements and addressing Hubble tension (74 vs 67 km/s/Mpc).

This README provides a comprehensive overview of the project while keeping it concise and actionable. It includes all key sections that users would expect while highlighting the scientific importance of the work.
